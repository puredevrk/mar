# MAR
After completing higher studies a student is expected to solve the problems of the society. 
S/he should be able to find out problems our society is facing today and will be facing tomorrow. 
They will be able to solve those problems. They will be able to work in a team.  
The world around us is changing at a very fast pace. 
When a student will come out with a degree after four years, s/he will certainly be thrown into a world with new challenges. 
They should be able to convert these challenges  into opportunities. 
Therefore a student must grow in all spheres besides her/his own subject.
In this direction a student has to achieve some mandatory extra points in order to earn Bachelors degree under MAKAUT
(Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology).
This will come under Mandatory Additional Requirements (MAR).
